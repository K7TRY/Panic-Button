# Panic-Button
A Raspberry Pi based panic button written in Python with a Bash watchdog script.

Function: This Python script makes a phone call, plays a message, and sends email with an attachment when a button is pressed.

My office receptionist needed a way to alert others that she needed help if there was a person acting weird or harassing her. 
So the Panic Button system was born. Tim H. wrote the first version. 
I was also inspired by https://github.com/shanepan/PanicButton/blob/master/panicbutton.py
